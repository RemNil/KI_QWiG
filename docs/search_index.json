Key Features Document &amp; Data Storage: MongoDB manages metadata and hierarchical structures. Qdrant powers fast vector search via Llama embeddings. SuperDuper adds an orchestration layer for seamless operations. Flexible, Traceable Linking: Connects dossiers, addenda, tables, sections, and more—including complex conceptual relationships. Ensures both human-readable and machine-consumable navigation paths. AI-Driven Search &amp; Analysis: Automates extraction, semantic search, and interactive analysis. Users ask questions in natural language and receive comprehensive, cross-document answers instantly. Security &amp; Scalability: Fully internal and compliant with data protection standards. Open-source and cost-effective, with effortless expansion as new documents are added. Why it matters Clinical development of new medicinal products is different from many other business models in that it critically depends on voluntary or even altruistic (Jansen 2009) research participation and hence on public trust. “Information gain per unit of accepted research burden” is a useful concept introduced to think about how the current regulatory oversight system learns from past clinical R&amp;D efforts – a prerequisite of earning public trust. Information cannot only be gained from performing clinical research but throughout the entire regulatory process including post-marketing health technology assessment. Hence, research responsibilities to make most out of the available information extends far beyond the publishing study results. In this spirit, the Dossier-Graph knowledge graph is designed to transform post-marketing health technology assessment data into actionable insights, honoring the contributions of the many patients involved in current research. By integrating state-of-the-art information technology throughout the drug development and regulatory lifecycle, this project advances the actionable use of critical research information.
