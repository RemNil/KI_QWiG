# Introduction

## Research Portfolios: Cohesive and Purposeful Clinical Research {-}

Ethical justification for the burdens placed on clinical research participants extends well beyond rigorous trial design. Modern scholarship stresses that trials should form part of an aligned **research portfolio**, where each study fills knowledge gaps and builds on prior evidence, contributing to a coherent, cumulative understanding of therapeutic questions. This portfolio approach is central for generating social value and ethically justifying participant burdens, as research efforts that are strategically linked offer a far greater return on participant contribution than isolated studies [@london2019clinical; @kimmelman2017drug; @kimmelman2015structure].

Evaluating clinical research from a **bird’s eye perspective**, particularly after drug approval, produces two key benefits:

1. **Improving Future Trials**: Analyses of existing research portfolios can highlight recurring challenges or risks; these insights directly inform the design, oversight, and safety of subsequent studies. For example, patterns identified at the portfolio level can help investigators anticipate methodological pitfalls or ethical concerns [@BittlingerPeppercornKimmelman2022].

2. **Revealing Research Gaps**: Only by viewing groups of related trials together do unmet needs and new research questions rise to the surface—questions invisible to single-study analysis, but crucial for continuous improvement and targeted innovation [@kimmelman2017drug; @london2019clinical].

#### 1. **Contextualizing Research Within the Scientific Continuum** {-}

- **Interdependence of Questions**: Each study should not exist in isolation. Instead, it should build upon previous findings and lay the groundwork for subsequent inquiry. This continuity ensures that research is not a series of disconnected efforts, but a tapestry of knowledge where each thread informs and supports the others.
- **Cumulative Value of Evidence**: The justification for involving participants must consider how the current research contributes to a growing body of evidence. Studies should be positioned to fill genuine knowledge gaps, refine existing understanding, or resolve uncertainties left by prior trials.

#### 2. **Strategic Question Selection and Research Prioritization** {-}

- **Meaningful Sequencing**: What we choose to ask next matters. The process of formulating research questions must be deliberate, ensuring they are timely, necessary, and logically connected to what has been already established. This sequencing maximizes the efficiency and impact of participant commitments.
- **Avoiding Redundancy and Waste**: By coordinating research agendas and sharing data openly, the field can prevent unnecessary replication and avoid subjecting participants to studies of limited incremental value.

#### 3. **Ethical Stewardship: Participant Burden in Perspective** {-}

- **Value Amplification**: When research questions are interconnected and aligned towards elucidating a coherent "bigger picture," the societal value gained for each participant’s sacrifice increases. Their contributions are part of a collective effort, not a solitary, potentially obscure, experiment.
- **Transparency and Trust**: Clearly articulating how each study fits within the broader research mission fosters public trust, honors participant altruism, and reinforces the legitimacy of the research burden.

#### 4. **Cultivating a Healthy Research Culture** {-}

- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Encouraging collaboration across disciplines and institutions ensures that research priorities are shaped by a diversity of perspectives and pressing clinical realities.
- **Vision and Foresight**: Healthy research ecosystems invest in horizon scanning—anticipating future questions and challenges—to guide present study designs and ethical considerations.


What if we could see the research landscape not as scattered trials, but as a living map of inquiry—constantly evolving, purposefully connected, and ethically aligned? With an AI-powered knowledge graph trained on the vast archive of HTA reports, could we finally chart clinical studies in real time, uncovering how each trial fits into the bigger picture—and whether it truly earns the burden it places on participants?

Dummy example is shown below:
```{r  fig.width=9, fig.height=6, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, results=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/streamgraph")
library(streamgraph)
library(readxl)
library(caret)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)

# "Medicines_output_european_public_assessment_reports.xlsx"
epar <- read.csv("epar_genus_proximum.csv", sep = ";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, check.names = FALSE)
names(epar)[1:2] <- c("year", "indication")

epar$year <- as.numeric(epar$year)

dmy <- dummyVars(" ~ .", data = epar)
trsf <- data.frame(predict(dmy, newdata = epar))

colnames(trsf) <- c("year", substring(colnames(trsf), 11,60)[2:453])
names(trsf) <- gsub("[.]", " ", names(trsf)) 

trsf %>%  
  tidyr::gather(indication, value, -year)  %>% 
  group_by(year, indication) %>%
  tally(wt=value) -> dat 

streamgraph(data= na.omit(dat), key="indication", value="n", date="year", 
            top = 20, right = 10, bottom = 30, left = 30,
            interactive=TRUE, order=("inside-out"), interpolate = "cardinal-open") %>%
  sg_axis_x(2, "year", "%Y") %>%
  sg_fill_brewer("YlOrRd")# "OrRd" "Spectral", "RdYlGn", "RdYlBu", "RdGy", "RdBu", "PiYG", "PRGn", "PuOr", "BrBG" "PuOr""
```
In such a Stream Graph [@byron2008stacked], the volume of individual streams is proportional to the values in each category (i.e. number of approvals per year and therapeutic area). This plot is  useful to quickly assess "trends" in approval rate per therapeutic area over time. 

For instance, if you hover over the graph, you will quickly discover that there were quite disproportionately many approvals for Arthritis lately. Shown are therapeutic indications mentioned in EPARS [@papathanasiou2016transparency]. Data freeze: 25. November 2019. Now imagine, we had retrospective access to the clinical trial application packages.
