# Project summary: Dossier-Graph {-}

Dossier-Graph is an open-source, government-grade knowledge graph system designed for research and education, built on public data from transparent health technology assessments [@IQWiG2023]

Its mission: transform a vast archive of dossier evaluations into a live, searchable database using AI.

### Key Features {-}

- Document & Data Storage:

  - MongoDB manages metadata and hierarchical structures.

  - Qdrant powers fast vector search via Llama embeddings.

  - SuperDuper adds an orchestration layer for seamless operations.

- Flexible, Traceable Linking:

  - Connects dossiers, addenda, tables, sections, and moreâ€”including complex conceptual relationships.

  - Ensures both human-readable and machine-consumable navigation paths.

- AI-Driven Search & Analysis:

  - Automates extraction, semantic search, and interactive analysis.

  - Users ask questions in natural language and receive comprehensive, cross-document answers instantly.

- Security & Scalability:

  - Fully internal and compliant with data protection standards.

  - Open-source and cost-effective, with effortless expansion as new documents are added.

### Why it matters {-}
Clinical development of new medicinal products is different from many other business models in that it critically depends on voluntary or even [altruistic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1353/hcr.0.0164) [@jansen2009ethics] research participation and hence on [public trust](https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjps/axz023/5524669?redirectedFrom=fulltext). *"Information gain per unit of accepted research burden"* is a useful concept [introduced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ECTE0gbwFU=0m52s) to think about how the current regulatory oversight system learns from past [clinical R&D efforts](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/laboratory-patient-journey-centrally-authorised-medicine_en.pdf) -- a prerequisite of earning public trust. Information cannot only be gained from performing clinical research but throughout the entire regulatory process including post-marketing health technology assessment. Hence, research responsibilities to make most out of the available information extends far beyond the publishing study results. 

In this spirit, the Dossier-Graph knowledge graph is designed to transform post-marketing health technology assessment data into actionable insights, honoring the contributions of the many patients involved in current research.

By integrating state-of-the-art information technology throughout the drug development and regulatory lifecycle, this project advances the actionable use of critical research information.
